- Free Software, free as in free speech and not as free beer
- Open Source

## Choose a license for project

Identify an appropriate license for your project and add it to the repo.

Following resources help in identifying a license:

- [choosealicense.com - Appendix](https://choosealicense.com/appendix)
- [opensource.google.com - Using](https://opensource.google.com/docs/using)

## License header for project code

Add license header to the project files.

Example:

```java

package com.example;

public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("This file has the source header");
}
```
